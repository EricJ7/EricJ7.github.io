        </div>
        <div class="projectDescription">
            <p>Designed and Implemented a circuit system in TinkerCAD using multiple Arduino UNOs for a Grade 12 Project.</p>
            <p>Circuit consisted of multiple sensors to detect a variety of harmful gases in the atmosphere. Each "slave" Arduino</p>
            <p>would send its environmental input to the main Arduino UNO for analysis. If the set threshold was passed for one of</p>
            <p>the gases, the main Arduino as well as the "slave" Arduino would begin to buzz at a high frequency and blink their LEDs</p>

            <a href="">Linear Algebra Visualization Tool</a>
        </div>
        <div class="projectDescription">
            <p>Tool for linear algebra to help visualize different vector operations, as well as other applications. Including: </p>
            <p>vector addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, transpose, matrix transformation. etc. Also able to compute the solution to a system</p>
            <p>of linear equations with multiple equations in 2d or 3D space. The solutions, as well as operations, are plotted using</p>
            <p>matplotlib and Axes3D, Numpy is used to solve the systems and the rest of the operations are implemented from scratch.</p>
            <p>Some default transformations are included such as a reflection in the x, or y axis, and a rotation of theta degrees below</p>
            <p>the x-axis. The option to view these transformations can be toggled in the GUI</p>
