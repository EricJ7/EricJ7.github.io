        </div>

        <div class="projectDescription">
            <p>Designed and Implemented a circuit system in TinkerCAD using multiple Arduino UNOs for a Grade 12 Project.</p>
            <p>Circuit consisted of multiple sensors to detect a variety of harmful gases in the atmosphere. Each "child" Arduino</p>
            <p>would send its environmental input to the main Arduino UNO for analysis. If the set threshold was passed for one of</p>
            <p>the gases, the main Arduino as well as the "child" Arduino would begin to buzz at a high frequency and blink their LEDs</p>

        </div>

        <div class="projectDescription">
            <p>Created a small Julia notebook in Jupyter to perform some operations on images such as converting an image to grayscale, 
                performing convolutions on images using specific kernels to generate blurred or sharpened images, to highlight edges, etc
                Made use of techniques such as normalization, clipping, and shifting to visualize the convolution.

        <div class="projectDescription">
            <p>Implemented linear regression in python from scratch to model the relationship between a persons age and their blood pressure.
                Made use of matplotlib to visualize the linear relationship on a graph. </p>

        <div class="projectDescription">
            <p>Tool to visualize vector operations such as addition, subtraction, transposition, matrix transformations (y-axis reflection, rotation by theta degrees) 
                etc. Able to compute the solution to a system of linear equations in 2D or 3D space, which would then be plotted with matplotlib and Axes3D. Numpy used 
                help to solve some of the more challenging aspects of solving systems. </p>
